		This example shows you how the validate.js library can be used to validate different kinds of valid email addresses and valid URLs.
        <br><br>
		When we use a library, we build on the knowledge of crowdsourcing, and this reduces the number of bugs our users and customers see.
        <br><br>
		Using a library, we enjoy the following benefits:

		<ul>
			<li>We enjoy bugfixes already submitted and fixed, years or decades ago.</li>
			<li>Our users experience less issues</li>
			<li>We save development time and get things done faster</li>
		</ul>
		
		When we try to do these things ourselves, such as using regular expressions to validate emails or URLs, we miss some use cases.
		<br><br>
		But none of this is new innovations. URLs and email addresses have been around for 40+ years, so there should never ever be any bugs related to validation of IP, URL, or email addresses because these problems were solved a long time ago.
		<br><br>
		"Don't reinvent the wheel."
