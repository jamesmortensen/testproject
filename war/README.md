This is a quick demo of validatejs being used to validate emails. To run a quick web server, run this from the root of the project to install #### a simple HTTP web server:

```
$ npm install -g http-server
```

and then to start the server, in the root directory of the project, run:

```
$ http-server -p 8091 . 
```

CMD-C or Ctrl-C stops the server.  

To load the project web page, go to [http://localhost:8091](http://localhost:8091).
